Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into the ASP.NET Core 9 request pipeline and had an amazing hands-on learning experience building a real-life API project using:

ðŸ”¹ Custom Middleware
ðŸ”¹ Request Timing Logging
ðŸ”¹ Global Exception Handling Middleware
ðŸ”¹ Model Validation with Custom Filters
ðŸ”¹ Custom Headers at both Middleware and Controller level

This helped me better understand how requests and responses are handled under the hood in ASP.NET Core.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

Middleware can intercept and process HTTP requests globally.

Exception handling can be centralized to return consistent JSON error responses.

Model validation can be cleanly handled using filters.

We can dynamically inject custom headers conditionally at the controller level.

I implemented all of this in a clean, modular way using Visual Studio â€” and it was super rewarding to see it working end-to-end!

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: ASP.NET Core 9, C#

ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™d love to hear how you use custom middleware in your projects â€” and open to feedback & suggestions too!
